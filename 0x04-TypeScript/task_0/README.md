# Task 0 - Basic TypeScript Interfaces

## Description

This task introduces basic TypeScript interfaces and demonstrates how to work with typed objects and DOM manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

- Create and use TypeScript interfaces
- Work with arrays of typed objects
- Manipulate the DOM with TypeScript
- Understand basic TypeScript compilation

## Implementation

The project creates a `Student` interface with properties:
- `firstName`: string
- `lastName`: string
- `age`: number
- `location`: string

It then creates a table in the DOM displaying student information (firstName and location).

## Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Open `dist/index.html` in a browser to see the rendered table.
